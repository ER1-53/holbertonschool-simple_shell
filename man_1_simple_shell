.P
Simple shell - The Simple shell utility is a custom command language interpreter that shall execute commands read. The Simple shell is a custom command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
A minimalistic approach was taken in its design and implementation to only provide the basic functions of a shell similar to the one.

.SS Overview
The simple shell takes input from either the terminal or scripts and executes them as they appear.

.SH INVOCATION
The GNU Compiler Collection, gcc, is recommended for compiling simple_shell with some extra flags.

.B $ ./hsh

.RE
In non-interactive mode, users can specify shell scripts to be executed by simple_shell usually through the use of pipes '|'.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the
shell to exit with a non-zero exit status. If the shell is not an interactive
shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted. Otherwise the shell will
return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is
used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.
